## What is **medienhaus/**?

**medienhaus/** is a project initiated by students, teachers and colleagues with the effort to create an easy to use, free and open-source, privacy and security focused solution for the solution for the online enhancement of the university.

We’d like to create a responsible tool for remote education using existing services that do not exploit the user and their data. **medienhaus/** includes:
- a space to **communicate**
- **meet** face to face
- **present** to each other
- **study** together

**medienhaus/** uses rooms as an extension for chats and talks, quick face to face meetings, presentations with groups of people, collaborative realtime writing and documentation and a solution for streaming online.

## I was told to join a room on **medienhaus/** … how do I do that?

If you are invited to a public room, let’s say by a teacher for an upcoming course, you can find the room in the `explore` tab. Invitations to privat rooms can be found at the left side of the screen in the classroom in the navigation column.

## I don’t know my password and/or username!

The password and username is the same you use for logging in to your UdK mail account. This integration unifies the login credentials and allows us to identify you as a part of the UdK, whether you are a student, teacher or associate.

## I need a chatroom for something. How can I create one?

You need to know that there are two kinds of chatrooms: public and private. You can freely create private rooms and personally invite your friends, colleagues or other people in the network. This group is only visible by the people who have access.

Public rooms on the other hand are, like the name suggest, public visible and can be seen in the `explore` tab. Public rooms should only be created if a strong incentive is given, that access to the information in these rooms should be publicly available.

Since in most cases a private room is enough, we choose to regulate the creation of public rooms by needing a request that can be found here.

To create a private room find the `+` button on the left side in the navigation column besides “Rooms”. Give it a name and a topic.

You now created a room where you can invite people to join the conversation by clicking on the name on the top and then “Person”. Search for the name and press “invite” … et voilà!

## I’d like to invite someone who is not yet in **medienhaus/** … does that work?

No, the person you want to invite to your room or want to start a direct message needs to set up their **medienhaus/** account by logging in with their credentials and finishing the setup. Public sharing of chatrooms is not possible.

## I’d like to leave a room. How can I do that?

To leave a room, open the room and click on the name at the top of the screen. Under “room settings’ you find the button “leave room”. Note that if you a are the last member of a room, the room will be closed and all chat messages will be lost. Make a backup beforehand! 

## I’d like to start a video chat with someone or with a group of people in a room. But how?

Besides the input field for your chat messages you can find a couple of icons: attach files, select emojis, voice call and video call. The latter two can be used to start a call using Jitsi, a self-hosted, free and open-source video call program, that is integrated in **medienhaus/** …

You can safely use Jitsi for one-on-one and group calls up to 10 people. You need to use a recommended browser like Chromium, Firefox or Chrome.

## How can I easily share collaborative notes with people in my room?

You can extend the functionality of your room by adding widgets like an Etherpad. This self-hosted, free and open-source application works like a privacy enhanced Google Docs.

Here you can share notes, long text documents or work on a text with people in your room. This way you can keep the chat for the chatting and have a place for your notes.

## Can I use my mobile or tablet for **medienhaus/**?

We optimized **medienhaus/** to be used in a desktop or laptop browser like Firefox, Chromium or Chrome.

## Why so complicated? Why not just use WhatsApp and Zoom?

**medienhaus/** strongly believes in responsible creation of tools and services for the online extension of education and information. That is why we host these services on our own hardware with controlled access.

Very little data is gathered and it will never be sold, used or in other ways exposed like in other services. **medienhaus/** also is a free service, you don’t pay with money or your data and attention span.

**medienhaus/** also separates your personal online services from your studies with all the tools you need. We truly do this for you and online education.
