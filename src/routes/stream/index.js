      <p>We will introduce RTMP live streaming here.</p>
      <p>You can use <strong>/stream</strong> for broadcasting your video (a webcam or your desktop) and audio (your voice via microphone or your music for example) to the internet.</p>
      <p>Live streaming is different than /meet in the fact that you can stream to an unlimited amount of people who just tune in to your stream with a link.</p>
      <p>You can incorporate this into a project of yours or use it for traditional live streaming to an audience. It is up to you how to use it.</p>
      <p><strong>/stream</strong> can be accessed via: <a href="https://stream.medienhaus.udk-berlin.de" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">stream.medienhaus.udk-berlin.de</a></p>
